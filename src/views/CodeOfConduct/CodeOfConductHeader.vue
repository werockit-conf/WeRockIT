      <p>
        The WeRockIT Conf Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put our values into practice. This Code of Conduct is
        built around the understanding that everything we do in connection with WeRockIT Conf will be, and should be,
        measured against the highest possible standards of ethical professional conduct. We have set that bar that high
        for practical as well as aspirational reasons. Our commitment to the highest standards helps us maintain the
        goals set forth by WeRockIT Conf. Respect for our industry peers, fellow conference go-ers, and for each other
        are instrumental to our success, and are something we need to support every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect board members, volunteers, and conference-goers to respect this Code of Conduct. Additionally, we
        expect contractors, service providers, consultants, etc. to also conduct themselves in alignment with our
        ethical and professional standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        So please do read this Code of Conduct, and follow both in spirit and letter. And if you have a question or ever
        think that one of our Board Members, Volunteers, or Conference go-ers, Service Providers, etc. or the conference
        as a whole may be failing to uphold our commitment, speak out.
