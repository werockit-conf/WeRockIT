    Note: Opted to use powershell since it also directly integrates into VSCode

2. Install Yarn, a project dependency manager, using the instructions from `https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable`

    Execute ```choco install yarn``` within a powershell terminal.

    Note: This will also install node.js as a yarn dependency. In case not installed, run ```cinst nodejs``` to install node.js.

    Note: Restart your computer for VSCode terminal to have yarn in the path to use within VSCode
